# generator-spsync

Used to generate small projects in SharePoint that files can be uploaded to the Style Library or Master Page gallery.

Uses Wictor Wilen's [gulp-spsync](https://github.com/wictorwilen/gulp-spsync) Gulp plugin. More can be read on this plugin at his [blog](http://www.wictorwilen.se/announcing-gulp-spsync-a-gulp-plugin-that-syncs-local-files-with-a-sharepoint-site)

Note that the project still in early development and may not work as expected.
